### **How to contribute?** 

* Open a **pull request** explaining your addition/fix. If it is an addition of a class or an algorithm please explain why it's useful and provide a url to a wikipedia page for the algorithm/data structure you're suggesting. *(Note that the code **must** follow our code-style to be accepted)*.

* Implementation is not everyting, you have to provide test cases in the **tests** folder for **EVERY** function you implement.

* Last but not least, you have to write some documentation in the **tutorial** folder for the users to know how to use your code. 

We are happy to see you contribute :).
